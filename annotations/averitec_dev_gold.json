The majority of deaths during the influenza pandemic of 1918-1919 were not caused by the influenza virus acting alone, report researchers from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health. Instead, most victims succumbed to bacterial pneumonia following influenza virus infection. The pneumonia was caused when bacteria that normally inhabit the nose and throat invaded the lungs along a pathway created when the virus destroyed the cells that line the bronchial tubes and lungs.\n\nA future influenza pandemic may unfold in a similar manner, say the NIAID authors, whose paper in the Oct. 1 issue of The Journal of Infectious Diseases is now available online. Therefore, the authors conclude, comprehensive pandemic preparations should include not only efforts to produce new or improved influenza vaccines and antiviral drugs but also provisions to stockpile antibiotics and bacterial vaccines as well.\n\nThe work presents complementary lines of evidence from the fields of pathology and history of medicine to support this conclusion. \"The weight of evidence we examined from both historical and modern analyses of the 1918 influenza pandemic favors a scenario in which viral damage followed by bacterial pneumonia led to the vast majority of deaths,\" says co-author NIAID Director Anthony S. Fauci, M.D. \"In essence, the virus landed the first blow while bacteria delivered the knockout punch.\"\n\nNIAID co-author and pathologist Jeffery Taubenberger, M.D., Ph.D., examined lung tissue samples from 58 soldiers who died of influenza at various U. S. military bases in 1918 and 1919. The samples, preserved in paraffin blocks, were re-cut and stained to allow microscopic evaluation. Examination revealed a spectrum of tissue damage \"ranging from changes characteristic of the primary viral pneumonia and evidence of tissue repair to evidence of severe, acute, secondary bacterial pneumonia,\" says Dr. Taubenberger. In most cases, he adds", "Did Dr Anthony Fauci publication blame masks for 1918-19 flu deaths ? Medical and scientific experts now agree that bacteria, not influenza viruses, were the greatest cause of death during the 1918 flu pandemic.\n\nGovernment efforts to gird for the next influenza pandemic \u2013 bird flu or otherwise \u2013 ought to take notice and stock up on antibiotics, says John Brundage, a medical microbiologist at the Armed Forces Health Surveillance Center in Silver Spring, Maryland.\n\nBrundage\u2019s team culled first-hand accounts, medical records and infection patterns from 1918 and 1919. Although a nasty strain of flu virus swept around the world, bacterial pneumonia that came on the heels of mostly mild cases of flu killed the majority of the 20 to 100 million victims of the so-called Spanish flu, they conclude.\n\n\u201cWe agree completely that bacterial pneumonia played a major role in the mortality of the 1918 pandemic,\u201d says Anthony Fauci, director of National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Disease in Bethesda, Maryland, and author of another journal article out next month that comes to a similar conclusion."]}, {"id": 71, "label": "Refuted", "evidence": ["How much was the India imports from China before April 2020?

A recent analysis of excess deaths from March through July reported very similar findings, but that study did not include more recent data through September (5).\n\nAlthough more excess deaths have occurred among older age groups, relative to past years, adults aged 25\u201344 years have experienced the largest average percentage increase in the number of deaths from all causes from late January through October 3, 2020. The age distribution of COVID-19 deaths shifted toward younger age groups from May through August (9); however, these disproportionate increases might also be related to underlying trends in other causes of death. Future analyses might shed light on the extent to which increases among younger age groups are driven by COVID-19 or by other causes of death. Among racial and ethnic groups, the smallest average percentage increase in numbers of deaths compared with previous years occurred among White persons (11.9%) and the largest for Hispanic persons (53.6%), with intermediate increases (28.9%\u201336.6%) among AI/AN, Black, and Asian persons. These disproportionate increases among certain racial and ethnic groups are consistent with noted disparities in COVID-19 mortality.***\n\nThe findings in this report are subject to at least five limitations. First, the weighting of provisional NVSS mortality data might not fully account for reporting lags, particularly in recent weeks. Estimated numbers of deaths in the most recent weeks are likely underestimated and will increase as more data become available. Second, there is uncertainty associated with the models used to generate the expected numbers of deaths in a given week. A range of values for excess death estimates is provided elsewhere (7), but these ranges might not refl", "Do the studies used to make the claim include lockdowns relating to excessive deaths? they do not mention lockdown factors in the excessive deaths", "Do the studies used to make the claim include lockdowns relating to excessive deaths? they do not mention lockdown factors in the excessive deaths"]}, {"id": 83, "label": "Refuted", "evidence": ["Did PA actually reject Mail in ballots?

Even if a person is wearing an airtight medical grade mask, like an N95 or FFP2 mask, the risks of lethargy, headache, and dizziness are low, even after wearing one for several hours. For an average healthy person wearing a cloth or surgical mask, there is even less risk of these symptoms occurring, because they still allow oxygen to flow out of the mouth and nose freely.\n\nWhile it might feel like breathing is more difficult in a mask and you are not getting enough air, that is likely a response to stress or anxiety from wearing the mask and can usually be helped by focusing on normal breathing patterns. Shallow breathing, hyperventilation, and breath holding can cause increases in carbon dioxide which leads to headaches and nausea. These symptoms are generally not caused by the use of masks.", "Does wearing a mask for long periods lead to CO2 intoxication ? Doctors typically refer to two distinct forms of oxygen deprivation: anoxic brain injuries occur when the brain is totally deprived of oxygen due to sudden cardiac arrest, choking, strangulation, and other sudden injuries. Hypoxic brain injuries occur when the brain receives less oxygen than it needs, but is not completely deprived of oxygen. Because the effects of the two injuries are similar, many brain experts use the terms interchangeably.\n\nA few seconds of oxygen deprivation won't cause lasting harm, so a child who holds his breath in frustration, a combatant choked unconscious during a Jiu-Jitsu match, and a diver who needs a few extra seconds to come up for air are unlikely to experience brain damage. The precise timeline of anoxic brain injuries depends on a number of personal idiosyncrasies, including overall brain and cardiovascular health, as well as the level of blood oxygenation at the time of injury. Generally speaking, injuries begin at the one-minute mark, steadily worsening thereafter.\nHow Long Can the Brain Go Without Oxygen? A Timeline\n\n    Between 30-180 seconds of oxygen deprivation, you may lose consciousness.\n    At the one-minute mark, brain cells begin dying.\n    At three minutes, neurons suffer more extensive damage, and lasting brain damage becomes more likely.\n    At five minutes, death becomes imminent.\n    At 10 minutes, even if the brain remains alive, a coma and lasting brain damage are almost inevitable.\n    At 15 minutes, survival becomes nearly impossible.\n\nThere are, of course, exceptions to every rule. Some training routines help the body make more efficient use of oxygen, enabling the brain to go longer periods without this vital element. Free divers routinely train to go long periods without oxygen, and the current record holder, Aleix Segura held his breath for 24 minutes and 3 seconds without sustaining brain damage!"]}, {"id": 173, "label": "Refuted", "evidence": ["Does wearing a mask lower Blood oxygen saturation levels? pulse oximetry showed no major changes in oxygen saturation.", "Do CO2 levels in the blood increase when wearing a mask? no major changes in end-tidal CO2 or  CO2\nretention"]}, {"id": 174, "label": "Refuted", "evidence": ["Can wearing masks cause neurological damage? \u201cThe prolonged use of medical masks can be uncomfortable.

In states with universal vote-by-mail like Colorado and Utah, we certainly see instances where submitted ballots are signed by someone other than the voter   and those are caught. There are security checks that should prevent the most egregious acts of fraud. However, signature matching is not an exact science, both in terms of qualifying votes that should be counted and votes that shouldn\u2019t be counted. But I do believe that processes in place are strong attempts to assure the security of the system.\u201d\n\nDr. Hood agrees:\u00a0\u201cIt really depends on the state - the United States basically has 50 different election systems with different safeguards. North Carolina has what they call witness affirmation   someone has to sign witnessing that the person sending the ballot voted the ballot. Another safeguard is if the state -- like Georgia -- requires voters to request absentee ballots. This way, the voter is initiating the process.\u201d", "What safeguards methods,  such as signature verification fraud security  are used in the state of New Jersey to prevent imposters from returning ballots in place of another voter? The county board of elections shall, promptly after receiving each mail-in ballot, remove the inner envelope containing the ballot from the outer envelope and shall compare the signature and the information contained on the flap of the inner envelope with the signature and information contained in the respective requests for mail-in ballots.  In addition, as to mail-in ballots issued less than seven days prior to an election, the county board of elections shall also check to establish that the mail-in voter did not vote in person.  The county board shall reject such a ballot if it is not satisfied, pursuant to a comparison with the Statewide voter registration system, that the voter is legally entitled to vote and that the ballot conforms with the requirements of this act.\n\n     In the case of a mail-in ballot to be voted at a primary election for the general election, the ballot shall be rejected if the mail-in voter has indicated in the certificate the voter's intention to vote in a primary election of any political party in which the voter is not entitled to vote according to the Statewide voter registration system, and if it shall appear from the record that the voter is not entitled to vote in a primary election of the political party which has been so indicated.\n\nAny mail-in ballot which is received by a county board of elections shall be rejected if both the inner and outer envelopes are unsealed or if either envelope has a seal that has been tampered with.

States have multiple tools to address valid security concerns and protect election integrity when it comes to mail ballots. And recent technologies and strategies have significantly enhanced the security of mail balloting.\n\nIdentity verification: The principal method used to detect and prevent fraud is the mail ballot envelope itself, where each voter must include personal identifying information (such as address, birthday, and driver\u2019s license number or last four digits of a Social Security number). In most states, that information includes a signature to match\u00a0against the voter rolls. \n\nBar codes: Most election jurisdictions now use some form of bar code on their ballot envelopes. These bar codes allow election officials to keep track of ballot processing and help voters know whether their ballot has been received. Bar codes also allow states to identify and eliminate duplicate ballots.\n\nBallot tracking through the U.S. Postal Service: In many jurisdictions, including California, Colorado and Florida, ballot envelopes are equipped with intelligent mail bar codes to track an envelope from drop-off to delivery and processing. \n\nSecure drop-off locations and drop boxes: Multiple ballot return options limit the opportunity for ballot tampering by fostering voter independence in returning a ballot.\n\nHarsh penalties: Anyone who commits voter fraud using a mail ballot risks severe criminal and civil penalties: up to five years in prison and $10,000 in fines for each act of fraud under federal law, in addition to any state penalties.\n\nPostelection audits: In 2018, a review of returned absentee ballot records helped identify anomalies in the election results of Bladen County, North Carolina, enabling election officials to uncover election interference by a political operative who stole and tampered with mail ballots.\n\nPolling sites as a fail-safe: if there are concerns that an eligible voter\u2019s mail ballots could be lost or uncounted, in-person polling sites provided."]}, {"id": 246, "label": "Refuted", "evidence": ["Is this virus new?

For example, Keriya County in Hotan had one of Xinjiang\u2019s highest natural population growth rates in previous years, with rates being nearly double those of Hotan City. Its first marked decline occurred in 2016, but the by far most dramatic drop (to -0.49\u2030) took place in 2018.\n\nIn 2018, minority regions in Xinjiang also deployed mass health exams to identify family planning violations.

The Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA) requires hospitals to stabilize all low-income individuals with life-threatening conditions, and Emergency Medicaid covers emergency services for immigrants who would otherwise qualify for Medicaid but for their immigration status. Thus, undocumented patients often receive care much later in the course of diseases, as documented in a study of New York City public hospitals. Often, individuals return repeatedly to emergency departments for the same condition. By delaying needed care, undocumented persons face serious, more costly, health conditions in the long term.
