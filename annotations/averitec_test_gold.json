Some people mistakenly took that to mean the remaining 94% of coronavirus-related deaths were caused by other underlying health conditions and not COVID-19.

One of the vaccines s the Comirnaty COVID-19 mRNA vaccine (also known as the \u2018Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA vaccine\u2019).\nWhat is mRNA?\n\nRibonucleic acid (RNA) is the genetic material in viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 (the COVID-19 virus). Once inside a human cell, SARS-CoV-2 RNA acts as messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA), which is a type of molecule used by the virus as instructions for making the proteins it needs to function. Human cells generate mRNA for the same purpose.\nHow do mRNA vaccines work?\n\nVaccines prepare the body to defend itself against a specific disease. mRNA vaccines contain pieces of mRNA that tell the cells in the body how to make a viral protein that will be recognised by the immune system as foreign.\n\nIn this case, the mRNA contains instructions for the spike (S) protein on the surface of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The S protein helps the virus enter human cells.\n\nCopies of the S protein are made in the body. The immune system recognises the S protein copies as foreign and makes immune cells and antibodies which can recognise and attack the SARS-CoV-2 virus via the S protein.\n\nThe mRNA is broken down shortly after vaccination. Animal studies showed that the mRNA in the Comirnaty vaccine is broken down within a couple of weeks.\n\nIf the body is later exposed to the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the immune system is prepared to defend the body against illness. As a result some people may not get infected at all. Others will experience a much milder illness than they would have done without the vaccine.", "Does the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines turns human body to virus making factory ? Vaccines train the immune system to recognize the disease-causing part of a virus. Vaccines traditionally contain either weakened viruses or purified signature proteins of the virus.\n\nBut an mRNA vaccine is different, because rather than having the viral protein injected, a person receives genetic material \u2013 mRNA \u2013 that encodes the viral protein. When these genetic instructions are injected into the upper arm, the muscle cells translate them to make the viral protein directly in the body.\n\nThis approach mimics what the SARS-CoV-2 does in nature \u2013 but the vaccine mRNA codes only for the critical fragment of the viral protein. This gives the immune system a preview of what the real virus looks like without causing disease. This preview gives the immune system time to design powerful antibodies that can neutralize the real virus if the individual is ever infected.\n\nWhile this synthetic mRNA is genetic material, it cannot be transmitted to the next generation. After an mRNA injection, this molecule guides the protein production inside the muscle cells, which reaches peak levels for 24 to 48 hours and can last for a few more days."]}, {"id": 56, "label": "Refuted", "evidence": ["How much does the UK spend on healthcare, The UK as a whole spends the equivalent of one quarter of total public expenditure and \u00a32,972 per capita in 2017.", "How much does Scotland spend on healthcare?

In limited studies among women with\nCOVID-19 and another coronavirus infection (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, SARs-CoV), the virus was not\ndetected in breastmilk. In a recent study from Wuhan, China, researchers collected and tested breastmilk samples\n(at first lactation) from six patients who had COVID-19 during pregnancy; all samples tested negative for the virus.\nHowever, more research is needed to confirm these results.

One of the main reasons is linked to the production of the food we eat, the milk we drink and even the shoes on our feet. This is because livestock farming is a major source of the greenhouse gases that are warming our planet. You need to chop down a lot of trees to make pasture for animals to graze and you need a lot of energy to keep meat cool and transport it around the world. Perhaps most importantly, ruminant livestock like cows, sheep and goats produce a lot of the potent greenhouse gas, methane.Most people have got the wrong end of the stick, and indeed the wrong end of the animal, when it comes to the source of methane. The vast majority, over 95%, actually comes from the animal\u2019s breath. This happens when animals 'chew the cud', a process which involves chewing food that has already been partly digested by the first of four stomach compartments.

The process of making mRNA from DNA is called transcription, and it occurs in the nucleus. The mRNA directs the synthesis of proteins, which occurs in the cytoplasm. mRNA formed in the nucleus is transported out of the nucleus and into the cytoplasm where it attaches to the ribosomes. Proteins are assembled on the ribosomes using the mRNA nucleotide sequence as a guide. Thus mRNA carries a \u201cmessage\u201d from the nucleus to the cytoplasm.

In October 2019, the Republican-led Pennsylvania General Assembly passed an election law, Act 77, that added no-excuse voting by mail, a provision pushed by Democrats. The act says that any qualified elector who is not eligible to be an absentee elector can get a mail-in ballot. Republicans got one of their priorities included too: elimination of straight-ticket voting. The bill drew supporters from both parties, but it had more support from Republicans.", "Was this believed to be consistent with the state constitution? Act 77 required constitutional challenges be brought within 180 days, but that didn\u2019t happen. After Trump lost the Nov. 3 election, U.S. Rep. Mike Kelly, R-Pa., and co-plaintiffs filed a case against state officials arguing that the mail-in ballot provisions in Act 77 were a violation. Kelly asked the court to prohibit the certification of results that included mail-in ballots or direct the Pennsylvania General Assembly to choose electors. \n\nOne week later, the state Supreme Court dismissed the petition as untimely, writing that the plaintiffs filed their case more than a year after Act 77 was enacted and after millions of residents had already voted in the primary and general elections. The case was filed as the final ballots \"were being tallied, with the results becoming seemingly apparent,\" the court wrote. The court\u2019s three page order did not address whether Act 77 and the state constitution were in conflict.\n\n\"Clearly the state legislature and governor believe it is consistent with the state constitution,\" Toomey said. \"This law wasn\u2019t challenged when it was passed, it wasn\u2019t challenged when it was applied during the June primary election. It was only challenged after President Trump lost the general election.\"", "Did Pennsylvania lawmakers pass a law that plainly violated the state's constitution? No. Senator Bob Casey said there is no part of Pennsylvania's constitution that makes in-person voting a 'requirement' and that mail-in balloting is legitimate."]}, {"id": 589, "label": "Refuted", "evidence": ["Is there any evidence found, through documents, testimonials, photographs or Physical evidence to back up the claim?

At any given moment about 2,000 thunderstorms roll over Earth, producing some 50 flashes of lightning every second. Each lightning burst creates electromagnetic waves that begin to circle around Earth captured between Earth's surface and a boundary about 60 miles up. Some of the waves - if they have just the right wavelength - combine, increasing in strength, to create a repeating atmospheric heartbeat known as Schumann resonance. This resonance provides a useful tool to analyze Earth's weather, its electric environment, and to even help determine what types of atoms and molecules exist in Earth's atmosphere.\n\nThe waves created by lightning do not look like the up and down waves of the ocean, but they still oscillate with regions of greater energy and lesser energy. These waves remain trapped inside an atmospheric ceiling created by the lower edge of the \"ionosphere\" - a part of the atmosphere filled with charged particles, which begins about 60 miles up into the sky. In this case, the sweet spot for resonance requires the wave to be as long (or twice, three times as long, etc) as the circumference of Earth. This is an extremely low frequency wave that can be as low as 8 Hertz (Hz) - some one hundred thousand times lower than the lowest frequency radio waves used to send signals to your AM/FM radio. As this wave flows around Earth, it hits itself again at the perfect spot such that the crests and troughs are aligned. Voila, waves acting in resonance with each other to pump up the original signal.\n\nWhile they'd been predicted in 1952, Schumann resonances were first measured reliably in the early 1960s. Since then, scientists have discovered that variations in the resonances correspond to changes in the seasons, solar activity, activity in Earth's magnetic environment, in water aerosols in the atmosphere, and other Earth-bound phenomena.", "What were the red spikes shown on the1st December 2020 spectogram?

Getting fully vaccinated is the best way of protecting you and others against COVID-19 and other respiratory infections.\n\nIf you have not yet received all the COVID-19 vaccine doses recommended for you, you should get vaccinated as soon as possible. It usually takes around two to three weeks for your body to develop its protective response. Meet outdoors or keep indoor spaces well ventilated\n\nMeeting outdoors vastly reduces the risk of airborne transmission, but this may not always be possible.\n\nIf you\u2019re indoors, you should let fresh air in to reduce the risk of catching or spreading COVID-19.\n\nThe more fresh air you let into your home or other enclosed spaces, the less likely a person is to inhale infectious particles.\n\nYou can let in fresh air by uncovering vents and opening doors and windows.

This is particularly important before, during and after meeting people you do not live with indoors.\n\nIf you are concerned about the costs of heating, opening windows for shorter periods of time can still help to reduce the risk of the virus spreading.

Our immune system fights disease by distinguishing between things that belong in our bodies and things that don\u2019t, destroying the latter. Unwanted foreign substances are identified by markers on their surface called antigens. A vaccine works by exposing the immune system to the antigens from a pathogen, something such as a virus or bacterium that causes a certain disease. When your immune cells encounter these antigens, they mount a response. One cell type \u2013 B cells \u2013 start making antibodies, which bind to the foreign substance, disable it and mark it for destruction. Other immune cells, known as T cells, attack and destroy cells of the body that have been infected by the pathogen. At the same time, the body also produces long-lived types of white blood cell \u2013 called memory T cells and memory B cells \u2013 that remember the antigens that have just been encountered. If your immune system comes across the same antigens again, these memory cells allow you to mount a strong response against that specific pathogen very quickly, so you are much less likely to get ill.", "How does vaccination work? The immune system is a network of cells, tissues and organs that work together to help fight off infection from harmful bacteria or viruses. When a disease-causing agent, such as virus or bacteria, invades your body, your immune system recognises it as harmful and will trigger a response to destroy it.\n\nOne of the ways your immune system fights off infection is by creating large proteins known as antibodies. These antibodies act as scouts, hunting down the infectious agent, and marking it for destruction by the immune system. Each antibody is specific to the bacteria or virus that it has detected and will trigger a specific immune response. These specific antibodies will remain in the immune system after the infection has gone. This means that if the same disease is encountered again, your immune system has a \u2018memory\u2019 of the disease and is ready to quickly destroy it before you get sick and any symptoms can develop.\n\nSometimes, however, the immune system doesn\u2019t always win this initial battle against the harmful bacteria or virus and you can become very ill or \u2013 in extreme cases \u2013 die. Vaccination is the safest and most common way to gain immunity against a bacteria or virus that your body has yet to encounter. Vaccines contain a harmless form of the bacteria or virus that causes the disease you are being immunised against. The bacteria or virus will be killed, greatly weakened, or broken down into small parts before use in the vaccine so that they can trigger an immune response without making you sick. Your immune system will still attack the harmless form of bacteria or virus from the vaccine and will produce antibodies to fight it off. The immune system then keeps a memory of the disease, so if a vaccinated person encounters the disease years later, their immune system is ready to fight it off and prevent an infection from developing."]}, {"id": 783, "label": "Not Enough Evidence", "evidence": ["Which parliament government sat for the longest number of hours The 17th Lok Sabha had the largest number of hours of 281 hours which is 135% of the scheduled time", "What was the average percentage of time spent by 17th Lok Sabha ministers to answer questions when compared to the average of the past 20 years 36% were answered by the 17th Lok Sabha ministers as against the 15% average of the past 20 years", "Which India's Parliament has the best performance recorded on their first term?

Viral infection initiates with attachment of the virus particle to the cytoplasm membrane on the cell surface, a process in which viral surface protein binds uniquely to specific receptors on the host cell. To block this viral attachment to target cells, antibodies that target the viral surface proteins specifically are secreted, which bind and neutralize the viruses, weakening their infective ability. However, in some viruses, the binding of specific antibodies to viral surface proteins can promote viral invasion into certain types of cell instead, and enhance viral infection. This effect is called antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) (see Glossary) (Taylor et al., 2015). ADE happens in two main cases: (1) when viral-specific antibody promotes viral entry into host monocytes/macrophages and granulocytes, and (2) when it enhances viral infection in cells via interplay with the Fc receptor (FcR) and/or complement receptor. Enhancement of the attachment between viruses and target cells play important role in most cases. ADE has been identified in over 40 kinds of virus. These viruses have several different antigenic epitopes, some of which induce neutralizing antibodies, while some stimulate enhanced antibodies.
